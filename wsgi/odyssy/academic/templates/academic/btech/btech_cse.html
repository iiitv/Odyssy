        <h2>Bachelor of Technology - Computer Science and Engineering</h2
        <br><br>
        The programme is designed to make a strong foundation in CSE that includes electronics and hardware. Computer
        science courses are introduced in the early semesters while non-IT courses in the later stages. IT workshops are
        specially designed courses allowing the students to have mastery in the use of the latest software technologies.
        The courses in mathematics, sciences, engineering and humanities enable students to explore the wider
        applications of technology.
