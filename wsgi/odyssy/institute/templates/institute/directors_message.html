                You have infinite potential. Your attitude can make or break you, so turn your attitude into one of
                gratitude, faith, trust, and above all optimism. A warm welcome to IIIT, Vadodara. Current environment
                is characterized by the need to constantly innovate and to reinvent oneself in order to sustain and grow
                one's stature in the industry. We, at IIIT-V believe that today's engineers need to inculcate in them
                the quality to adapt to the changing environment and to possess an action oriented approach. The primary
                goal of IIIT-V is to provide an environment that helps our students - future engineers and leaders of
                the country - to realize their potential in full. Along with expertise in core subject knowledge we aim
                to improve their communication skills, critical thinking abilities, problem solving skills, creativity,
                moral values and sense of responsibility. Our educational and training programmes are anchored around
                the same philosophy. Though still at its nascent stage, IIIT-V has started fostering a vision of
                becoming a leading Institution of the country. As an institute, we are committed towards creating a
                community which is vibrant and provides a lifetime learning experience both professionally and
                personally.
